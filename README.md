## Awesome Data Science
From the "Awesome Data Science" page, I chose the from the Data Mining Algorithms. From there, I read about _k_-means clustering. This is a kind of vector quantization that groups data by into unlabeled points. This is based on the similarities between data points and differences to another cluster of data points. It can be used in a variety of real world. For banks and schools, they use it  compare individuals and their grade/credit score. It is a useful tool for large datasets as it compresses large data sets into easily read and applicable figures.

## Free Data Science Book
I chose _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Hadley Wickham is a New Zealand based statistician currently working at Posit. Garrett Grolemund is also at Posit as an statisician and R developer. The book is also collaborative, with almost 100 additional contributors listed. I have limited experience in R and am currently brushing up on my R skills. This book seems like the perfect way to introduce more statistic and programming theory into my vocabulary. The book is also free to use and the authors encourage donating to an endangered bird; the Kākāpo.
